## About

### Open-Science-Poster

The Open-Science-Poster
[repository](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Poster) contains a LaTeX
document which is thought to be forked and used for scientific, collaborative
poster writing on GitHub. The Open-Science-Poster combines the LaTeX typesetting
capabilities with the power of the R programming language for statistics, using
the [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. This combination allows for the
production of executable documents which enhances the reproducibility of your
research.

The Open-Science-Poster offers a clean and logical folder structure
and some example data of typical things required to typeset your
poster. A makefile helps you to compile, clean and archive the
document. The layout of the document is close to common scientific
poster formats. It is inspired by the layout of the [Jacobs
University](https://teamwork.jacobs-university.de:8443/confluence/display/CoPand
BiG/LaTeX+Poster) and extends upon. For an example see the
PDF file in the repository or the documentation in the
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Poster/wiki).

The project is documented in detail on the Open-Science-Poster
[wiki](https://github.com/cpfaff/Open-Science-Poster/wiki). It covers
information about how to get started with the document, a workflow for
collaborative poster writing on GitHub and much more.
